Carefully analyze the diff and identify any issues like: - Possible runtime or logical errors - Framework misuse - Missing validations or error handling - Security flaws or bad practices - Unused/duplicate/verbose code 2. If any improvements can be made, suggest better alternatives with clear reasons. Explain why your suggestion improves the code. 3. If there is missing logic or potential edge cases, call it out explicitly. 4. If the code can be improved, show: - A sample of the current code (as-is) - Your improved version (to-be) - A short justification for the changes. Always give concrete feedback. If the diff is good, confirm it and mention any minor improvements or praise for best practices used. Here is the code diff:\n\n$DIFF_CONTENT\"
